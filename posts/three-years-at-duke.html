            As summer winds down and senior year approaches, I have found myself reflecting on my time at Duke University. I came to Duke almost three years ago, at seventeen and a few months old. Traveling across the country alone, that was the first time I had been to another state in the Union; earlier that summer was the first time I returned to M&eacute;xico since immigrating to the Bay Area in 2001. But that was one of the reasons I chose to go to Duke: I thought college should be a time for finding your identity independently of your family.

            I intended to major in Mathematics and try out Computer Science my first semester at Duke, and three years later I have finished the requirements of my CS degree and need only Real Analysis to finish off my Math degree. This was both intended and surprising. When I was obsessively drafting the courses I would take early in my Duke career, my plan was to essentially finish my major requirements and general education requirements&mdash;known as Trinity Requirements or T-Reqs here at Duke&mdash;by the end of my Junior year, allowing me more freedom during my senior year to take courses I am interested in. But the road to this point was paved with uncertainty and difficulty, academic and otherwise.

            The intro-level classes of the Duke Mathematics Department are notoriously difficult. Entering Duke I heard horror stories from upperclassmen about these classes and their strange grading scheme. Math 122L: Calculus II had the worst reputation of all; of course, this was the class I was scheduled to take. Despite the warnings, I trekked onwards.

        <div class="text">
            At the time, I chose to study math because no other subject interested me or challenged me in the same way. I could not envision myself majoring in any other subject, for that matter. However, I was fortunate to have recieved support early in my Duke career that has enabled me to pursue and succeed in mathematics at Duke. I am grateful for the advisement and encouragement provided by my pre-major advisor and Calculus II professor.
