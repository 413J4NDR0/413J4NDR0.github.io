            As summer winds down and senior year approaches, I have found myself reflecting on my time at Duke University. I came to Duke almost three years ago, at seventeen and a few months old. Traveling across the country alone, that was the first time I had left California since immigrating to the Bay Area in January 2001. But I chose Duke because I thought college should be a time for forging your identity independently of your family.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            I intended to major in Mathematics and try out Computer Science my first semester at Duke, and three years later I have finished the requirements of my CS degree and need only Real Analysis to finish off my Math degree. But the road to this point was paved with uncertainty and difficulty, academic or otherwise.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            At the time, I chose to study math because no other subject interested me or challenged me in the same way. I could not envision myself majoring in any other subject for that matter. Not particularly convincing reasons to study this demanding discipline. However, I was fortunate to have recieved support early in my Duke career that has enabled me to pursue and succeed in my studies. I am grateful for the advisement and encouragement provided by my pre-major advisor and Calculus II professor; without them, I doubt I would have made it this far. 
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Perhaps the most obvious lesson I have learned from my studies in mathematics and from my life experiences is learning to fail. Having turned twenty last May&mdash;and yes, I do not turn 21 until a week before graduation&mdash;I have endured countless failures over two decades, from my coursework to my friendships. I often questioned over the last three years whether I was taking full advantage of the opportunities presented to me. But I have made peace with my past decisions, and I am excited to make the most of my Senior year.

        <div class="text">
            Some weeks before I left for Duke, my dad asked me &laquo;<em style="font-family: serif">&iquest;Tienes miedo, cabr&oacute;n? &iquest;De qu&eacute;? T&uacute;, quien habla ingl&eacute;s, dime, &iquest;qu&eacute; te asusta? Si vine a este pa&iacute;s a los dieciocho a&ntilde;os sin nada, sin dinero y sin saber el idioma, &iquest;qu&eacute; te podr&iacute;a asustar?</em>&raquo; Y le dije, &laquo;<em style="font-family: serif">No le tengo miedo a nada.</em>&raquo; 
        </div>

            Of course, he was implying if I was afraid of going to Duke University since I would be on my own, and at the time I had no idea what to expect from this university in Durham, North Carolina. After three tumultuous years, I can say for certain that I have learned to appreciate the people in my life, and to fear nothing.
