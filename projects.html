        <p class="text">
            This research independent study is focused on latency reduction for distributed systems; in particular, the project is conducting experiments on several state of the art networks being implemented, from a <b>microwave-based telecommunications system</b> connecting the New York and Chicago metropolitan areas intended for financial traders to <b>satellite-based systems</b> being built in a New Space Race by private companies. I will be working with a group of academics from several universities&mdash;including my superviser Bruce Maggs&mdash;in analyzing latency, packet loss and other key metrics and whether reaching the lowest theoretical boundary for internet speed is possible for these systems.

        <h2 >Classical Codes and Unitary Designs for Quantum Computing</h1>
        <div class="text">
            This is a research independent study I am undertaking during the Fall 2018 semester supervised by Robert Calderbank. The focus is on error correcting codes for quantum computing, which are essential to achieving fault-tolerant quantum systems. The <b>Heisenberg-Weyl group</b> \(HW_N\), where \(N=2^m\), is fundamental to quantum computation: in physics it arises as the Pauli group, where it describes the possible discrete state transitions and errors in an \(m\) qubit quantum system; in mathematics, it appears as the extraspecial group, where it provides the framework for orthogonal and symplectic geometry. The goal of the project is efficiently generating unitary designs, finite approximations of the Haar random unitaries. Haar random unitaries are essential in quantum computation but inefficient to implement for large \(m\), hence the interest in finite approximations.

                <li>
                    <b>The Heisenberg-Weyl and Clifford Groups:</b>
                    Let \(S = \{ I_N, -I_N, i I_N , -iI_N\} \), which is a subgroup of \(HW_N\). Prove that the graph
                    \( \Gamma_N \) constructed from the quotient group \(HW_N/S\) is strongly regular and that the
                    automorphism group \(\text{aut}(\Gamma_N)\) is the Clifford Group \(\text{Cliff}_N\)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Pauli Mixing:</b>
                    Translate the concepts of Pauli Mixing to the transitivity of group actions by \(\text{Cliff}_N\)
                    on the vertices, edges, and non-edges of \(\Gamma_N\). Prove that the Clifford ensemble \(G\)
                    is Pauli Mixing

                <li>
                    <b>Unitary 2- and 3-Designs:</b>
                    Prove that Pauli Mixing implies that the Clifford ensemble is a unitary 2-design and that Pauli
                    2-Mixing implies that the Clifford ensemble is a 3-design

        <div class="text">
            I was recruited to work on the PEAK project during the summer of 2018, adding features to the platform that improved the data pipeline in a team of three interns. There were three main objectives:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Data Extraction:</b> A significant portion of the documents in the PEAK database are PDFs, which are notoriously difficult to extract data from. Primarily, the interest was in extracting the tabular data embedded in the PDF documents in a format suitable for visualization and analysis, i.e. CSV files. The final product was an algorithm that detected tables within the PDF document using the Hough Transform and regular expressions, and extracted the tabular data into a CSV file by leveraging open-source software.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Document Categorization:</b> Improving the facted and semantic search functionality of the platform by categorizing documents based on keywords and ontological frameworks. The final deliverable extracted keywords from the entirety of the document and performed a page-by-page analysis through NLTK. The GitHub repository can be visited <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ortega-alejandro/pdf-autocategorization"><b>here</b></a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Data Identification:</b> Although the corpus of PEAK documents is expected to grow from researchers uploading documents, there is an interest in giving the platform the ability to automate this process by identifying relevant articles from websites of interest. To this end, our team designed a webscraper that succesfully scraped all PDF and Excel documents from 18 sites of interest, and then processed these documents through a binary classifier trained on the current PEAK corpus to determine if the documents were relevant.
