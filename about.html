        <p class="text">
            As I mentioned on my homepage, I am Alejandro Ortega, currently a senior at Duke University studying 
            Mathematics and Computer Science. For a TLDR: I was born in M&eacute;xico but grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, 
            mostly in the City of South San Francisco. If you are for some reason interested in more details, continue reading.
        </p>

            I was born in Irapuato, GTO, M&eacute;xico in May 1998, and spent the first two years of my life on my paternal 
            family's farm in P&eacute;njamo, GTO, M&eacute;xico. Both of my parents are from P&eacute;namo, and the majority 
            of my family continue to live in the city. On a mild tangent, people born in Irapuato are known as 
            <em>freseros</em> because the city is famous for its strawberries, and P&eacute;njamo is known as
            <em>la cuna de la independencia</em> since the city is the birthplace of Don Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, who 
            began the Mexican War of Independence against Spanish colonial rule in 1810. Unsurprisingly, I do not remember much 
            from this time.
        </p>

            My father has a long history with San Francisco, and decided to permanently move us to the Bay Area in early 2001. 
            We settled in South San Francisco, CA, known as South City to locals. Living on the border of South City and 
            San Bruno, we were ten minutes away from both Tanforan shopping mall and YouTube's headquarters. On another tangent,
            during World War II, Tanforan&mdash;then a racetrack&mdash;served as a processing center for Japanese Americans
            of the Bay Area as a result of Executive Order 9066 that began the unconstitutional internment of American citizens 
            on American soil. Having only ever called the Bay Area home, these Americans
            were forcibly relocated to internment camps and had their properties forfeited and seized; at Tanforan, they slept in 
            horse stables, bleachers and hastily built barracks, before they were processed and sent to camps for the remainder of 
            the war. My family would often go to Century Plaza 10 to watch movies, when fifty years earlier a blatant disrespect for 
            human rights was occurring on the other side of the street. Of course, this is mostly a forgotten story even in my city, 
            and certainly not acknowledged by out-of-towners chasing profits at tech companies.

            I actually didn't know I lived so close to YouTube's headquarters until much later. For the most part, the only influence
            the tech sector had on my family was the high cost of living, which in recent years has skyrocketed to 
            unreasonable extents. I remember my father picking up old&mdash;and free&mdash;computers from the local Goodwill 
            that ran operating systems several years older than myself. Needless to say, I had very little exposure to technology 
            despite growing up in the Bay Area.

            My family moved to Richmond, CA in early 2005, a major city in the Bay Area that is the northern-most point of the East Bay.
            For people unfamiliar with the geography of the Bay Area, San Francisco is connected to Oakland via the Bay Bridge, and 
            Richmond is some 35 minutes north of Oakland. Unfortunately, the three years we lived in Richmond coincided with 
            a massive increase in crime that placed the city in the top five nationally for murder rate. 
            Perhaps the only good to have come from this time was the birth of my sister, who is featured in my profile picture.

            Eventually, my parents cut their losses and we moved to Hayward, CA, in 2008, a major city some 30 minutes south 
            of Oakland in the East Bay. However, we would only spend about a year in Hayward before returning to South San 
            Francisco in 2009, where we have been since.

            Unlike the overwhelming majority of my peers at Duke University, a distinguishing feature of my upbringing was the
            diversity of my schools and my friends: 
        </p>
        <ul style="padding-left: 15%" class="text">
            <li>
                <b>Los Cerritos Elementary</b> in South City was about 60% Latino and 30% Asian (K-2); 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary</b> in Richmond was about 60% Latino and 30% black (3 months of 3rd Grade); 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>St. Cornelius Catholic School</b> in Richmond was about 90% Latino, and the remaining 10% was Asian or black (4-5);
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Southgate Elementary</b> in Hayward was about 45% Latino, 35% Asian and 10% black (6); 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Martin Luther King, Jr. Middle</b> in Hayward was about 65% Latino, 20% Asian and 10% black (3 months of 7th Grade);
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Parkway Heights Middle</b> in South City was about 80% Latino and 15% Asian (7-8);
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>El Camino High</b> in South City was about 40% Latino and 50% Asian (9-12)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">
            Also unlike my peers at Duke University, I attended seven schools before matriculation, a number that
            still seems astounding. Although attending a University that is about 48% white was more of a culture 
            shock than I could have anticipated, I have enjoyed my time at Duke University immensely.
